           Earthquakes are one of the deadliest natural disasters killing on average 10,000 people annually (National Geographic, 2024), this demonstrates the clear need for an accurate detection of these seismic waves. 
           Previous studies have heavily highlighted the use of vast interconnected seismic networks to present data, however trying to understand and analyse the data has always been the overarching issue. Recent studies
           have shifted to the use of AI, particularly machine learning to leverage past events to predict future seismic activity (Zhou et al., 2017). Methods such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference systems (ANFIS) have 
           started to be used due to its ability to process complex non-linear data present, this allows it to process historical seismic data to strongly predict aftershocks at a precision of 92.5% (Bhatia, Ahanger and
           Manocha, 2022, p.1). However, this all depends on the quality of information provided by the seismic data, as AI progress on we can only expect this percentage to rise and become even stronger. This paper also
           covers the investigation into the use of deep learning models and found promising results that encourage further use of it to predict earthquake patterns.

      Dramsch (2020, pp. 1-55) describes the underlying components of machine learning algorithms involves training the system on existing data with known outcomes, eventually enabling them to get consistent results
      on new unexplored data. Machine learning is now one of the fundamentals, when it comes to earthquake detection showing promise in not only speed but accuracy.  Therefore the use of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy
      Inference Systems (ANFIS) is beneficial to earthquake detection due to its ability to combine machine learnings vast data driven capabilities with fuzzy logic which helps it to handle uncertainty in the data (Bhatis,
      Anger and Manocha , 2022). This is particularly useful in seismic data due to the large amounts of random noise present in the data (Leduc, Hulbert and Jhonson, 2019). This helps us to now understand 100% of the
      data or to discard bits as noise. Mirrashid (2014, pp. 1577-1593) tested the use ANFIS to predict earthquakes of 5.5 magnitude between 1950 and 2013, using seismic indicators as input to the model, his results
      showed that prediction were made with a high accuracy. Whereas zeng, zhao and yin(2016) used the magnitude and depth of hypocentre as input to predict epicentral intensity. The use of ANFIS in both natures
      highlights the multifaceted use of AI tools, and its utility in every nature, but with both test the magnitude was limited between 3 and 5 once its at 6 the test shows poor results. This reveals a clear error in
      the methods used to calculate earthquake prediction mainly due to data scarcity.
