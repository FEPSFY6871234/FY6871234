           Earthquakes are one of the deadliest natural disasters killing on average 10,000 people annually (National Geographic, 2024), this demonstrates the clear need for an accurate detection of these seismic waves. 
           Previous studies have heavily highlighted the use of vast interconnected seismic networks to present data, however trying to understand and analyse the data has always been the overarching issue. Recent studies
           have shifted to the use of AI, particularly machine learning to leverage past events to predict future seismic activity (Zhou et al., 2017). Methods such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference systems (ANFIS) have 
           started to be used due to its ability to process complex non-linear data present, this allows it to process historical seismic data to strongly predict aftershocks at a precision of 92.5% (Bhatia, Ahanger and
           Manocha, 2022, p.1). However, this all depends on the quality of information provided by the seismic data, as AI progress on we can only expect this percentage to rise and become even stronger. This paper also
           covers the investigation into the use of deep learning models and found promising results that encourage further use of it to predict earthquake patterns.
