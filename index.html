           Earthquakes are one of the deadliest natural disasters killing on average 10,000 people annually (National Geographic, 2024), this demonstrates the clear need for an accurate detection of these seismic waves. 
           Previous studies have heavily highlighted the use of vast interconnected seismic networks to present data, however trying to understand and analyse the data has always been the overarching issue. Recent studies
           have shifted to the use of AI, particularly machine learning to leverage past events to predict future seismic activity (Zhou et al., 2017). Methods such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference systems (ANFIS) have 
           started to be used due to its ability to process complex non-linear data present, this allows it to process historical seismic data to strongly predict aftershocks at a precision of 92.5% (Bhatia, Ahanger and
           Manocha, 2022, p.1). However, this all depends on the quality of information provided by the seismic data, as AI progress on we can only expect this percentage to rise and become even stronger. This paper also
           covers the investigation into the use of deep learning models and found promising results that encourage further use of it to predict earthquake patterns.

         Dramsch (2020, pp. 1-55) describes the underlying components of machine learning algorithms involves training the system on existing data with known outcomes, eventually enabling them to get consistent results
         on new unexplored data. Machine learning is now one of the fundamentals, when it comes to earthquake detection showing promise in not only speed but accuracy.  Therefore the use of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
         Systems (ANFIS) is beneficial to earthquake detection due to its ability to combine machine learnings vast data driven capabilities with fuzzy logic which helps it to handle uncertainty in the data (Bhatis,
         Anger and Manocha , 2022). This is particularly useful in seismic data due to the large amounts of random noise present in the data (Leduc, Hulbert and Jhonson, 2019). This helps us to now understand 100% of the
         data or to discard bits as noise. Mirrashid (2014, pp. 1577-1593) tested the use ANFIS to predict earthquakes of 5.5 magnitude between 1950 and 2013, using seismic indicators as input to the model, his results
         showed that prediction were made with a high accuracy. Whereas zeng, zhao and yin(2016) used the magnitude and depth of hypocentre as input to predict epicentral intensity. The use of ANFIS in both natures
         highlights the multifaceted use of AI tools, and its utility in every nature, but with both test the magnitude was limited between 3 and 5 once its at 6 the test shows poor results. This reveals a clear error 
         in the methods used to calculate earthquake prediction mainly due to data scarcity.

       Over the most recent years, the use of deep learning is a lot more prominent in papers. Misra and Li(2020, pp. 183 – 217) describes deep learning as several processing layers that learn complex abstraction by
       building hierarchy of abstractions, the many computational layers between the input and output result in both linear and non – linear transformations. This is very valuable for earthquake prediction, due to the 
       large amounts of non-linear data that we can’t explain given out by seismic machines and as its constantly giving out data this allows the deep learning model to continuously improve. Recent research by Khan and 
       Kwon (2022) presented a deep learning model to detect P-waves, they found that they could detect this P-wave within 1.5 – 2.5 seconds with an accuracy of 98.8%.  This is very valuable as P- waves travel faster
       and come before the destructive S-wave (Fischer et al., 2012), so by detecting a P-wave we can prepare for earthquake evacuation as there is a time delay between the S and P waves.
      <img src="Fig 1 P-Detector.png" width="1000" height="500">
      Fig. 1. P-Detector
      The above fig 1 represents the P-wave detection model, that feeds seismic waveforms into a convolutional neural network model to classify the P-wave from noise signal (Khan and Kwon, 2022). 
      This therefore allows us to identify potential P-waves and evacuate cities accordingly. A real-world application of this is CrowdQuake which uses both deep learning model and Internet of Things (IoT) to detect 
      earthquakes. IoT allows us to acquire real time sensor data (Bhatia, Ahanger and Manocha, 2022) this allows for faster detection and higher accuracy.

    <pre>
      Earthquakes not only halt the many lives of the inhabitants in the places it strikes, but the socioeconomic growth of the country itself. Being such a deadly force of nature, trying to detect is most prominent,
      technological advancements in the recent years such as IoT has aided this. However, trying to pin-point where it is going to occur is still a challenge, while you can somewhat predict an earthquake these are 
      all of magnitude of less than 3.5. This is mainly due to the lack of data in earthquakes of magnitude greater than this, the new research gives us hope and especially deep learning can help us to find a solution 
      to this unthinkable problem.
